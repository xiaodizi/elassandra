Installation
============

There are a number of ways to install Elassandra:

- tarball_
- `deb`_
- `rpm`_
- `docker image`_.
- `helm chart`_ (kubernetes)
- `Google Kubernetes marketplace`_

Elassandra is based on Cassandra and ElasticSearch, thus it will be easier if you're already familiar with one on these technologies.

.. important:: Be aware that Elassandra need more memory than Cassandra when Elasticsearch is used and should be installed on machine with at least 4Gb of RAM.

Tarball
-------

Elassandra requires at least Java 8. Oracle JDK is the recommended version, but OpenJDK should also work as well.
You need to check which version is installed on your computer::

    $ java -version
    java version "1.8.0_121"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.121-b13, mixed mode)

Once java is correctly installed, download the Elassandra tarball:

.. parsed-literal::

    wget |tgz_url|

Then extract its content:

.. parsed-literal::
  tar -xzf elassandra-|release|.tar.gz

Go to the extracted directory:

.. parsed-literal::
  cd elassandra-|release|

Configure ``conf/cassandra.yaml`` if necessary, and then run::

  bin/cassandra -e

This has started cassandra with elasticsearch enabled (according to the ``-e`` option).

Get the node status::

  bin/nodetool status

Now connect to the node with cqlsh::

  bin/cqlsh

You're now able to type CQL commands. See the `CQL reference <https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.3/cql/cql_reference/cqlReferenceTOC.html>`_.

Check the elasticsearch API::

  curl -X GET http://localhost:9200/

You should get something like this:

.. parsed-literal::
  {
    "name" : "127.0.0.1",
    "cluster_name" : "Test Cluster",
    "cluster_uuid" : "7cb65cea-09c1-4d6a-a17a-24efb9eb7d2b",
    "version" : {
      "number" : "|version|",
      "build_hash" : "b0b4cb025cb8aa74538124a30a00b137419983a3",
      "build_timestamp" : "2017-04-19T13:11:11Z",
      "build_snapshot" : true,
      "lucene_version" : "5.5.2"
    },
    "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
  }

You're done !

On a production environment, we recommand to to modify some system settings such as disabling swap. This `guide <http://docs.datastax.com/en/landing_page/doc/landing_page/recommendedSettings.html>`_ shows you how to do it.
On linux, you should install `jemalloc <http://jemalloc.net/>`_.

Deb

.. include:: adhoc_deb.rst

Rpm

.. include:: adhoc_rpm.rst

Docker image
------------

.. include:: docker.rst

Helm chart
----------

.. include:: helm.rst


Google Kubernetes Marketplace
-----------------------------

You can deploy an Elassandra cluster on `GKE <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/>`_ with a few clicks using our 
`Elassandra Kubernetes App <https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/strapdata/elassandra>`_ 
(require an existing GCP project and a running Google Kubernetes Cluster).


Running Cassandra only
----------------------

In a cluster, you may need to run Cassandra datacenter without Elasticsearch indexing. In such case, change the CASSANDRA_DAEMON variable 
to **org.apache.cassandra.service.CassandraDaemon** in your ``/etc/default/cassandra`` on all nodes of your Cassandra only datacenter.
